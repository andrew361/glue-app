After all these years there has been little improvement as patients only follow through with approximately fifty percent of the prescribed regimen, be it prescription medicine or exercise programs.  There have been several attempts to improve this level by using approaches such as reminders, pill counters, simplification of regimen, reducing the cost of medications, etc.  However, these approaches, as good as they might be, do not typically address why a patient would not follow their assigned regimen in the first place. If the regimen is good for the patient and will lead to a speedy recovery, why are the adherence levels still so low?           \n        section.cell\n          h3 The Solution\n          h2 Develop a deeper understanding of patient beliefs\n          p by simply evaluating a patientâ€™s beliefs in their ability to carry out a regimen and the threat posed by the illness, health care personnel can be provided with a picture of how a patient will adhere. This information can be used to better educate and motivate the patient for adherence. Further trials and testing are needed in order to prove the accuracy of the adherence prediction.
